# LibCal Custom Hours Display
My adapted version of code used to display library hours data from Springshare's LibCal vertically. I found this code several years ago and can't remember where. I will find the source and link out to it soon.

This code pulls from Springshare's LibCal system to display hours in a way that's customizable. 

You will need your IID and any LIDs from your LibCal system to make this work. The IID can be found on the Hours -> Widgets page and the LIDs from the locations can be found next to each location in the Hours settings.
